PROJECT TITLE: Projectile Motion Simulator
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To simulate a simple obejct flying through the air
VERSION or DATE: Version 1.0
AUTHORS: Austin Lynch
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
    OVERVIEW: This is a capstone where in a window with graphical representations, a user may set
              a vector of a specified length (determining inital kinetic energy of the projectile)
              and angle from the horizontal in order to locate the approximate location of the projectile
              after launch.
              
    TOPICS COVERED: To complete this project, I had to have an understanding of the methods in the math
                    class, as well as understand classes, subclasses, and inheritance. A series
                    of if statements and boolean variables to determine state were also vital
                    to make the GUI clean and efficient. I also had to research Timer and Timertask in
                    order to make the animation functional.
    TO RUN: Use the public static void main string[] args found in the projectile motion class.
            Drag the mouse to any point to set your vector and magnitude 
           (x component has a limit of 500 centiJoules) and click the Launch button to watch things fly.
           If your forget to set a vector hakuna matata (no worries!) a default x and y velocity will be
           set.
